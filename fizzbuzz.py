#In this assignment, you’ll build a FizzBuzz project from scratch. 
#In the original game of Fizz Buzz, you count from 1 to a given number (let’s say 100). 
#If the number is divisible by 3, instead of the number you say “fizz”. If it’s divisible by 5, you say “buzz”. 
#And finally if it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, you say “fizz buzz”. 
#So, counting from one to fifteen, you’d say: 
#“One, two, fizz, four, buzz, fizz, seven, eight, fizz, buzz, eleven, fizz, thirteen, fourteen, fizz buzz”.
#FizzBuzz is a great small project to do as it brings together all of the programming fundamentals we’ve learned so far. 
#And its also a popular problem that interviewees will be asked to solve in technical interviews.
#Assignment Requirements:-
#Have a hard-coded upper line, n.
#Print "Fizz buzz counting up to n", substituting in the number we'll be counting up to.
#Print out each number from 1 to n, replacing with Fizzes and Buzzes as appropriate.
#Print the digits rather than the text representation of the number (i.e. print 13 rather than thirteen).
#Each number should be printed on a new line.
